# Roll Master

Link has become a master of rolling!

This mod improves Link's rolling by removing the brief pause between rolls, allowing for fluid, continuous movement. You also have directional control during a roll, allowing a bit more flexibility in your movement.

Optionally, rolling is even faster when wearing the Bunny Hood, making traversal quicker and more responsive. To keep things balanced, speed is clamped when jumping with the Bunny Hood to prevent unintended skips or sequence breaks.

There are also optional dust particles when you roll to give you a sense of speed, this can be turned off in the config options too.

There are many optional features in this mod, so be sure to check out the configuration menu. Many features that are enabled by default can be disabled.
